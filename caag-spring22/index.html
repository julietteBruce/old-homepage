	will occur on the weeks when there is no Fellowship of the Ring talk beginning on January 25th. The goal will be to have
	two 50-minute talks covering things related to commutative algebra and algebraic geometry.

	In this introductory talk, I will describe how algebraic geometers have extended foundational results on mixed volumes in convex geometry through a process called "Tropicalization", with special attention to the application of establishing log-concavity of sequences associated to graphs and hyperplane arrangements.

	On projective space the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a module can be characterized in terms of the minimal graded free resolutions of the module and its truncations. On more general toric varieties the analogous relationship between multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and truncations does not hold. I will discuss recent work exploring the relationship between multigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford, truncations, Betti numbers, and virtual resolutions for modules on products of projective spaces.

	 Let X in \(\mathbb{P}^{n+e}\) be any n-dimensional closed subscheme. In this talk, I will consider two notions related to syzygies: one is the property \(N_{d,p}\) (\(d\geq 2, p\geq 1\)), which means that X is d-regular up to p-th step in the minimal free resolution and the other is a new notion ‘ND(\(\ell\))' which generalizes the classical “being nondegenerate” to the condition that requires a general finite linear section not to be contained in any hypersurface of degree \(\ell\).
 First, as introducing condition ND(\(\ell\)) we'll regard examples and basic properties deduced from the notion. And I'll explain some consequences of these notions including sharp upper bounds on the graded Betti numbers of the first non-trivial strand of syzygies, which generalize results in the quadratic case to higher degree case. I will also introduce some open questions at the end of the talk.

	Inspired by Quillen’s use of cohomology to study the representation theory of finite groups geometrically, Avramov and Buchweitz established some remarkable facts about modules over complete intersection rings using "cohomological support varieties". The utility and scope these varieties has continued to grow since - for example Pollitz used (a generalisation of) them to characterise complete intersection rings purely in terms the structure of their derived categories. More recently, in joint work with McCormick and Pollitz, we enrich the support varieties to a nested sequence of varieties called "cohomological jump loci” which I will talk about here.
	<br>
	<br>
	These can detect finer information than the support varieties alone, and we use this to enhance known symmetries in the homological algebra of complete intersection rings. To be precise: let M be a finitely generated Maximal Cohen-Macaulay module over a local complete intersection ring. The sequence of Betti numbers of M grows like a polynomial, and the same goes for the dual module M^*. Avramov and Buchweitz showed that these polynomials have the same degree for M and M^*. We use jump loci to prove that they even have the same leading term.

	One of the foundational results connecting syzygies with key algebraic geometry properties was Mark Green’s result on N_p conditions for smooth curves of high degree.  A modern and streamlined proof of this result comes via Green’s Linear Syzygy Theorem (which had originally been conjectured by Eisenbud and Koh).  I will discuss very recent work with Michael Brown which proves a Multigraded Linear Syzygy Theorem and uses this to obtain the first known examples of “virtual" N_p conditions for smooth curves of high degree in other toric varieties.  This is joint work with Michael Brown.

	 I will introduce the fiber-full scheme which can be seen as the parameter space that generalizes the Hilbert and Quot schemes by controlling the entire cohomological data. In particular, given a sequence of functions (h_0,..,h_n) the fiber-full scheme parameterizes subschemes X of P^n satisfying dim H^i(X,O_X(v)) = h_i(v). In this talk I will sketch the construction of the fiber-full scheme and describe some examples associated with classical Hilbert schemes. Time permitting, I will also discuss various future directions one can pursue. This is joint work with Yairon Cid-Ruiz.

	A Tate resolution for a sheaf F on projective space is a doubly infinite complex over an exterior algebra that encodes the cohomology of all twists of F. Its construction can be used to efficiently compute sheaf cohomology. Recently Michael Brown and Daniel Erman generalized this idea to general toric varieties. I will discuss their variation and its applications.

	The Hilbert-Burch theorem is a structure theorem for resolutions of length 2. Is it the "best possible" structure theorem in this setting? In Hochster's 1974 CBMS talks, he proposed pursuing generic/universal resolutions for each resolution format (i.e. fixed sequence of Betti numbers), which would give a precise way of answering this type of question. The length 1 case is trivial and the length 2 case is fully understood, but the construction for length 3 is much more involved. I'll focus on some formats which are particularly nice from this standpoint and discuss some recent joint work with Lorenzo Guerrieri and Jerzy Weyman.

      The Chow ring of a variety packages information about its subvarieties and how they intersect (a sort of "algebraic version" of the cohomology ring). When studying Chow rings of moduli spaces, there are often certain "tautological" classes that arise naturally from the moduli problem. The Chow ring of the moduli space M_g of curves of genus g is known for g \leq 6 (Mumford, Faber, Izadi, Penev--Vakil). In each of these cases, the Chow ring is generated by tautological classes. We prove that the Chow ring of M_g is tautological for g = 7, 8, 9, thereby determining the Chow rings by earlier work of Faber.  A key ingredient is our study of the Chow rings of Hurwitz spaces H_{k,g}, parametrizing degree k, genus g covers of P^1 for k \leq 5. This is joint work with Samir Canning.
